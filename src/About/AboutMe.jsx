              Programming Passion
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Hi, I'm Ambia Khatun Ela, a current student of Computer Science
              and Engineering (CSE). My programming journey began when I was
              fascinated by the idea of building something from scratch, just by
              writing code. Initially, I was overwhelmed, but the more I
              learned, the more I fell in love with it. Today, Iâ€™m passionate
              about solving problems and writing clean, efficient code that
              makes an impact.

              My name is Ambia Khatun Ela. Since my childhood, I have been
              fascinated by technology. Initially, programming felt a little
              overwhelming, but over time it became a creative art form for me.
              Whenever I solve a problem, it feels like Iâ€™m unlocking a new
              world. Besides programming, I also love drawing. It helps me relax
              and sparks new ideas.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Additionally, I enjoy playing football. Thereâ€™s something
              refreshing about sports that helps me stay energized. I believe
              itâ€™s crucial for a programmer to stay both physically and mentally
              healthy, as it enhances creativity and productivity at work.
